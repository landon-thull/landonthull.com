## Source Code

- [Github](https://github.com/landon-thull/c-colors)

## Platforms

- MacOS
- Linux

This library will not work on Windows without enabling ANSI colors in the registries.

## Summary

C library with functions for printing text with ANSI colors to the console. Includes functions for printing colored normal font, bold font, underlined text, and text with a colored background. Each function resets the console to the default color after printing the text it was passed. I used ANSI color codes from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/JBlond/2fea43a3049b38287e5e9cefc87b2124).
